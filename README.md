# GGSEsurfingSimulateClient
A GGSEsurfing Simulate Client for my unversity
This is C#-based EsurfingClient
Because the Original Client too useless to use,i dont like it.
So I decided to make a Esurfing Client in my university.

Thanks to PandaAdap give me a big help

I wish you like my project!

First use must be set up Wlannacip and Wlanuseip.
and only one program can be opened at a time, otherwise there will be a bug!
